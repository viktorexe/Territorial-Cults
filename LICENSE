# 📜 License (The Legal Stuff, But Make It Cool)

Hey there! 👋 So you wanna know about the legal side of things? Cool, let me break it down for you in human terms:

## 🎮 The Deal

This bot was crafted with love, energy drinks, and countless late nights by **viktorexe** in July 2025. Here's what you can and can't do with it:

### ✅ What You CAN Do (Go Wild!)
- Use this bot on your Discord server (that's literally what it's for!)
- Look at the code and learn from it (knowledge is power!)
- Modify it for your own server's needs (make it yours!)
- Share it with your friends (spread the love!)
- Fork it and make your own version (creativity rocks!)

### ❌ What You CAN'T Do (Please Don't)
- Claim you made this (that's just not cool, dude)
- Sell it as your own product (it's free for a reason!)
- Remove the credits to viktorexe (give credit where it's due!)
- Use it for anything illegal or harmful (be a good human!)

### 🤝 The Real Talk
This is basically a "do whatever you want, just don't be a jerk about it" license. Use it, modify it, learn from it, have fun with it! Just remember to give props where props are due.

If something breaks and your server explodes (digitally speaking), that's on you to fix. I built this thing with care, but I can't guarantee it'll work perfectly in every situation.

### 💝 The Bottom Line
This bot exists to make Discord servers more fun and bring gaming communities together. As long as you're using it in that spirit, we're all good!

**TL;DR:** Use it, love it, just don't steal credit for it. We cool? We cool. 😎
